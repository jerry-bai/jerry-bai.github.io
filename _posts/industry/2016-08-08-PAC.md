## Test Engineer

As a member of the End to End Testing team in the Development and Test Engineering department at Panasonic Avionics Corporation (PAC), I assist in the development, testing, release, and integration efforts of software and hardware, as well as all other end to end testing activities associated with our various products.

I work closely with the different departments related to system development and customer facing engineering teams, with the end goal to develop in-flight entertainment and communications (IFEC) solutions tailored to meet the needs of the customer. To meet this goal, I need to ensure that the processes between design and delivery is managed properly.

To deliver a great product on-time and on target, I use a comprehensive set of engineering skills, backed by a deep knowledge of IFE systems. With assistance from experts in hardware, software, manufacturing engineering, design, and electronics, I plan and perform reliability tests, conduct failure analysis, and troubleshoot problems, to quickly identify and resolve any issues early in the development cycle, and implement processes and procedures that eliminate problems at the root cause.

My team contributes to improved system performance, help identify ways to design exceptional new products, and enhances our test environments.<!--Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption-->

### Responsibilities

* Software integration of new and/or existing systems, functions and Line Replaceable Units (LRU) designed by the Software Development groups.
* Integration test of LRU and system functionality.
* Ensure all testing is properly documented and submitted.
* Coordinate activities for systems development, integration, test, and software/hardware release.
* Software and system testing of all In-flight Entertainment (IFE) functionality for existing systems.
* Participate in the design and development of all IFE system functionality.
* Participate in all efforts in the testing and regression testing of
software phase releases.
* Assist and support all engineering efforts company-wide as required.
* Develop test plans and procedures to validate system requirements.
* Troubleshoot problems reported for all
Panasonic Avionics IFE products.
* Conduct in-depth troubleshooting and analyze root cause of any system anomalies/discrepancies in hardware and/or software.
* Use test frameworks to automate system tests
* Peer review test cases
* Provide solutions and recommendations to project lead.

<!--#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="half">
    <a href="/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg"><img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>-->

<!--#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Alternative way

Another way to achieve the same result is to include `gallery` Liquid template. In this case you
don't have to write any HTML tags â€“ just copy a small block of code, adjust the parameters (see below)
and fill the block with any number of links to images. You can mix relative and external links.

Here is the block you might want to use:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Parameters:

- `caption`: Sets the caption under the gallery (see `figcaption` HTML tag above);
- `cols`: Sets the number of columns of the gallery.
Available values: [1..3].

It will look something like this:

{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}-->
