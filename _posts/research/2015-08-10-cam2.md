## Research Member

Many public cameras stream data continuously, but that data is never analyzed or archived. These streams can provide useful information about weather, traffic, etc.

Streaming data, especially video, requires heavy computation. Any system to analyze such data must be scalable and efficient with minimal latency. CAM2 allows researchers to test their video analysis methods at unprecedented scale by running on thousands of cameras simultaneously and then displays their results.

CAM2 is cloud-based system for studying the worldwide phenomena using network cameras. CAM2 provides an event-based API and is open to researchers to analyze the data for their studies. The web interface allows users to select the cameras for analysis. The cloud computing engine can scale in response to the needs of analysis programs.

As a research member, my main goals are to assist the research team in creating computer vision programs to analyze image and video, manage cloud resources efficiently for large-scale data analytics, and discover network cameras.

<!--[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is a simple way of including Tex/LaTex/MathML based mathematics in HTML webpages. To get up and running you need to include the MathJax script in the header of your github pages page, and then write some maths. For LaTex, there are two delimiters you need to know about, one for block or displayed mathematics `\[ ... \]`, and the other for inline mathematics `\( ... \)`.

## Usage

To enable MathJax support be sure Kramdown is your Markdown flavor of choice and MathJax is set to true in your `_config.yml` file.

~~~
markdown: kramdown
mathjax: true
~~~

~~~
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering:
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
~~~

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering:
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

The only thing to look out for is the escaping of the backslash when using markdown, so the delimiters become `\\[ ... \\]` and `\\( ... \\)` for inline and block maths respectively.


$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
